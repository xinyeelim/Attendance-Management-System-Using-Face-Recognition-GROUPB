# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life cycle

The project management life cycle is represented and documented in the form of Gantt Chart which allows QTMT staff to follow the guidelines and achieved the milestone from time to time. The project life cycle WBS breakdown the task and work of every members such as project manager into several modules. Every member have their own roles and part in every stage of the lifecyle based on the constructed WBS.

### Scope
A work breakdown structure (WBS) is created to map all the necessary tasks and develop the process which the WBS will be maintained and approved.

The system mainly works around 2 types of users

1. Employee
2. Admin

Following functionalities can be performed by the admin:
- Login
- Register new employees to the system
- Add employee photos to the training data set
- Train the model
- View attendance report of all employees. Attendance can be filtered by date or employee.

Following functionalities can be performed by the employee:
- Login
- Mark his/her time-in and time-out by scanning their face
- View attendance report of self

### Risk Identification Chart (Quality, Cost, Time)

| Control Element | What is likely to go wrong? | How and when will I know? | What will I do about it? |
|-----|----|-------|-----|
|Quality <br> (Poor attitude toward quality; substandard design, materials, and workmanship; inadequate quality assurance program)|1. Inadequate Quality Assurance Program: The system confused similar faces. <br><br> 2. Inadequate Quality Assurance Program: The quality of the AI model is biased towards a certain race or skin color.  |How: The output result always mismatch the face to the user or does not detect a face at all. <br> <br> When: The quality problem of will be determined during the unit testing phase|Assign one member to keep on collecting the data day to day and increased the dataset until a satisfied result is determined.|
|Cost <br> (Estimating errors; inadequate productivity, cost, change, or contingency)|1. Contigency: The costing of the server runtime is high if left connected and unattended. <br><br> 2. Inadequate productivity: Team members working from home will generate longer server uptime which will increase cost. |How: The monthly bills shows unexpected extra charged to the bills.<br><br>When: The problem most probably will be encountered during the project execution and project implementation.|Notify the owner if server runtime exceeds certain amount of hours.
|Time <br> (Errors in estimating time or resource availability; errors in determining the critical path; poor allocation and management of float; early release of competitive products) | 1. Project not able to reach the milestone set in the Gantt Chart. <br><br> 2. Erros in estimating resource availability: Server overload and does not have enough capacity to train the model.  |How: Member(s) could not complete the task and did not inform during progress meetings <br><br> When: The problem will be encountered during the project excution and monitoring phase.| Encourage members to be open on their issues regarding the project and discuss it during meetings.|
